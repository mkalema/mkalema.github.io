Question 1:
undefined889101

undefined: x is initialized but not declared since javascript only hoists declarations and not initializations

8: the passed argument a to function 8 to function c

8: the passed argument a which is 8 is assigned to b and printed in same function

9: b is 9 which was argument passed to function c. the b in inner function f "dies" when function is done execution

10: b is 10 from the global variable. the b in function c is now "dead" because c is done executing

1: x is now 1 from global variable


Question 2:
Global scope means variables are accessed from anywhere in the javascript program whereas local scope means they can only be accessed within a function

Question 3:
a) No : variables defined inside a function are not accesible from outside the function
b) Yes : functions can access global variables or variables in scope enclosing it
c) No : variables defined inside a function are not accesible from outside the function
d) Yes : functions can access global variables or variables in scope enclosing it
e) Yes : functions can access global variables or variables in scope enclosing it. C is inside B which is inside A . we can say C is enclosed in A

Question 4:
81 : x is declared and assigned before function call so it has value 9
25: x is reassigned to 5 before second function call and so has value 5 instead of 9

Question 5:
10 : when function bar is called local variable is foo is hoisted and so has value undefined. The check !foo evaluates to true and then assignment to 10 is done
alert now prints value in foo which is 10
